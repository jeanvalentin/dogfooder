## Healthy dog

Should I feed the dog? Maybe someone else in the house fed the dog but I can't be bothered to ask everyone every time so whatever let's build an app for that.

Dogfooder is called Dogfooder because of [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) and also because it is actually about dog food.

## How it works

See when the dog was last fed. When you feed the dog, tap the button and it stores the time in a cookie. Do not give cookies to the dog.

It has a picture of my dog but it works for any dog.
